# Explored Options in Dashboard
## Found a Solution that I felt like suited the project
Time - 15 minutes
- Went to https://www.arcgis.com/apps/solutions/index.html?gallery=true&sortField=relevance&sortOrder=desc#home
- Explored different Soutions that would be relevant to the project
- Deployed both the Citizens Problem Reporter and the Conservation Outreach Solutions

## Explored Interfaces
Time - 30 minutes
- Looked at the way data was collected for both Solutions
- Both had surveys in Survey123

- Because Survey123 has the option to submit a form without an account, this could be a really solid option for this project. This way anyone on the campus could submit an issue to the maintenance team without needing to log into an account.
- Viewed Dashboards to see how data was displayed.
- Looking at the Dashboard, I decided that the Conservation Outreach Solution was more promising, as it included a map rather than just statistics.
- Explored different settings in Dashboard, as I was unfamiliar with the application.
- When exploring the dashboard, I noticed that a mobile view could be added in case one of the senior staff wanted to view progress on their phones

## Added Test Data
Time - 15 minutes
- Used the Survey123 form in my browser to add a point.
- Viewed this in the Dashboard.
- Noticed that cases that are more critical show up in te side bar, could be useful for the project to show which cases are more critical

- In the future, should look at other elements/statistics that would be useful to SAWC. There may be may data points, senior staff could use dashboard to understand if certain weeks have more issues than others
