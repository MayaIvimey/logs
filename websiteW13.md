# Work on the website in week 12
## Implement accordions for methods using JavaScript
Time: 1.5 hour
- Took JavaScript from https://github.com/matthewdematos/a3web/blob/main/JavaScript/Scripts.js
- took the expanding buttons JavaScript to create accordions that drop down with each step

- Placed in the CSS for the expanding buttons

- wrote some of the HTML to test the buttons

- realized that this bit of css was putting a line through the problem statement button

- spent time looking through the JavaScript only to realize the script needed to be referenced after the body HTML and before the footer

- now the button clicks down

- tried to figure out why the line kept showing up on the active button in the nav bar

- Realized that in was overiding a previous class

- Tried changing it to just target the button
- ![image](https://github.com/MayaIvimey/logs/assets/146374490/284b69b2-a082-4379-8ea8-6d3c63f2e207)
- That made it always negative
- ![image](https://github.com/MayaIvimey/logs/assets/146374490/6f3eff59-8caa-485a-bbdf-6288f2182595)
- Changed the class name to active1
